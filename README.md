Real-Time Multi-Exchange Orderbook Viewer with AI Analysis
This project is a sophisticated financial data visualization tool built with Next.js. It provides a real-time view of cryptocurrency order books from multiple major exchanges, including OKX, Bybit, and Deribit.

The core feature of the application is its order simulation capability, which allows users to place hypothetical market or limit orders and instantly visualize their potential placement and impact on the order book. This is enhanced by an integrated AI-powered analysis feature, which uses the Google Gemini API to provide intelligent feedback on simulated trades and overall market sentiment.

The user interface is designed to be clean, responsive, and professional, featuring a minimalist black-and-white theme with fluid animations powered by GSAP.
